Teclib’ Edition is very excited to announce it’s participation for this year Hacktoberfest, where there are more than +300 tasks from Teclib’s projects for any programmer to prove him/herself as an Open Source and Free Software true advocate.

Hacktoberfest is the biggest Open Source celebration there is so far, where developers from all over the world participate actively in labeled open issues from GitHub. All participants would also be able of creating issues for this event as long as they label it with #Hacktoberfest.

This festival is the perfect shot to show skills as a programmer by doing contributions that not only will help you grow personally, but professionally through networking and professional development for future recruitment opportunities. 

Teclib’s Collab Community welcomes every free software enthusiast to participate on its projects during this whole month of October, and to keep in touch for further participations. The members of the community will receive invitations for future events, courses, webinars, meetups, first-hand documentation and important announcements about projects such as GLPI and Flyve MDM.

To participate in our projects, collaborators must sign-in in the [Hacktoberfest official site](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), and choose any of our open issues from these projects to make great contributions:
