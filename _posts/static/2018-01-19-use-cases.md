# Dashboard Use Cases

Flyve MDM Web Dashboard is a centralised mobile device management tool, allowing to efficiently control your mobile fleet with an intuitive and secure user interface.

Designed to work with GLPI, it requires the GLPI API Rest with which to save glpi/flyve users.

## 1. Create Account

To manage the mobile fleet the Administrator must create an account in Flyve MDM with just an email, once it is validated, the Administrator will be able to create and control the mobile fleets.

As previously said the Dashboard works with the GLPI API Rest, therefore it is necessary the session token since the endpoints will require it, this is obtained with the init session.

## 1.1 Login

To Login the Administrator uses his email and password, with this the session token is generated.

## 2. Invite Agents

When the Administrator sends the invitations, an email is received by the users with a Deeplink or QR code, these contain the following information:

* the URL of the backend for REST API requests
* an user API token belonging to a human user account
* an invitation token
* the name of the company's helpdesk
* the phone number of the company's helpdesk
* the website of the company's helpdesk 
* the email of the company's helpdesk

## 3. Enrollment

When a device is enrolled succesfully, it self-creates an user account.

It sends to the backend the following information:

* The email address where the invitation was sent
* Invitation token sent in the deeplink
* Phones provided by the user in enrollment
* First Name provided by the user in enrollment
* Last Name provided by the user in enrollment
* Serial of the device
* UUID of the device

## 4. Fleet Control

### 4.1 Files & Apps

To deploy files and Apps, they must be added on the Dashboard so they can be available on the fleets.

Once this is done and the fleet is applied, the Agent will receive a MQTT message with the information to start the download using an HTTP request.

## 5. Updating Users information

The Administrator of the fleet can modify the users information and even his own.

The fields are the same for both type of users, however the Administrator will have more options to update in the Settings section.

### Fields in the sections

* Names
* Phones
* Add password to allow login
* Add validation dates

## 6. Agent's Danger Zone

Each device has a Danger zone where to implement severe actions, those are:

* Wipe the device, erase all data
* Unenroll will remove the Agent application from the device and unapply the different policies
* Delete the device will remove the agent from the database, this will erase all the information of the device from the Dashboard
