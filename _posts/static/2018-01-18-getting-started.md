The New Generation of the Web Dashboard presents a brand new design.

Here weâ€™ll guide you in the steps to manage your mobile fleet from the basics introducing the different sections that conform the Web Dashboard.

## Create Account

To create an account you only require an email address and fill the form, then you'll receive an email to validate your account.

You can now Login and take full control of your IT infrastructure.

## Enrolling Agents

In order to manage the agents, you must invite the user of the device, go to the Invitations section, click on the "+" button and write the email of the user whose device you'll control.

Automatically, the user will receive an invitation in his email account.

Please note that the users must have installed in their devices the Android or iOS MDM Agent, see these links for more information:
