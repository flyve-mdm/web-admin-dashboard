Flyve MDM Web Dashboard is a centralised mobile device management tool, allowing to efficiently control your mobile fleet with an intuitive and secure user interface.

Designed to work with [Flyve MDM plugin](http://flyve.org/glpi-plugin/) for GLPI and [Flyve MDM Demo plugin](http://flyve.org/demo-mode/), it requires the GLPI API Rest with which to save glpi/flyve users.

## 1. Create Account

To manage the mobile fleet the Administrator must create an account in Flyve MDM, this is possible thanks to Demo plugin, since it allows the self-creation account. Fill the form, once the account is validated, the Administrator will be able to access to the management features for the mobile fleets.

As previously said the Dashboard works with the [GLPI API Rest](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/blob/9.1/bugfixes/apirest.md), therefore it is necessary the session token since the endpoints will require it, this is obtained with the init session.

## 1.1 Login

To Login the Administrator uses his email and password, with this the session token is generated.

### 2.1 User Invitation

To enroll a device, the Administrator must send an enrollment invitation to the email of the owners of the devices with the [MDM Agent](http://flyve.org/android-mdm-agent/) installed, the email contains a Deeplink which has the following information:

* the URL of the backend for REST API requests
* a user API token belonging to a human user account
* an invitation token
* the name of the company's helpdesk
* the phone number of the company's helpdesk
* the website of the company's helpdesk
* the email of the company's

### 2.2 Enrollment

The user must open the email with the invitation from the device to start enrollment, once it is enrolled succesfully a user account is created, the following information is sent to the backend:

* The email address where the invitation was sent
* Invitation token sent in the deeplink
* Phones provided by the user in enrollment
* First Name provided by the user in enrollment
* Last Name provided by the user in enrollment
* Serial of the device
* UUID of the device

## 3. Device Management

### 3.1 Fleets & Policies

The administrator must group the enrolled devices in fleets to apply the different policies massively, a device can be assigned to only one fleet from the Agent section.

#### Some of our Policies

* Password, set the specifications as
  * Lenght
  * Quality
  * Minimun of letters (lowercase and uppercase)
  * Minimun of numbers
  * Wipe the device at a number of failed attempts to unlock the device
* Encryption of Internal Storage
* Disable
  * Airplane mode
  * Cameras
  * Wifi
  * Bluetooth
  * GPS
  * USB
  * Mobile line
  * MMS and SMS
  * Speakerphone
  * Roaming
  * NFC
  * Creation of VPN profiles
* And many more.

### 3.2 Files & Apps

To deploy files and Apps, they must be added on the Dashboard before implementing the policy, otherwise they won't be available at the moment.

Once this previous step is done and the fleet is assigned, the Agent will receive a MQTT message with the information to start the download using an HTTP request.

### 3.3 Agent section

There are some features only available from this section, such as:

* Geolocalization: locate the device in real time.
* Ping: verify the connection with the device.
* Fleet: assign the Agent to the fleet.

#### Danger zone

Each device has a Danger zone which contains severe actions that once applied can't be undone, when it is required the Administrator can:

* Wipe the device: remove all data.
* Unnenroll: unenrolls the Agent then delete it from the DB.
* Delete the device: deletes the Agent from the DB immediately, in case of lost or theft.

After unenroll the Administrator must [enroll](#enroll) the Agent again.

## 4. Updating Information

### 4.1 Users

The Administrator of the fleet can modify the information of every user registered, this includes his own, from the users section.

### Fields in the sections
